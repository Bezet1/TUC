# TUC

The algorithm can resolve logic gates using input and output files. It works by taking in two separate files as input.
The first file contains information about the logic gates, including their type and their inputs and outputs. Each line of the file represents a separate logic gate.
The second file contains the initial input values for the logic gates. Each line of the file represents a separate input.
Program reads the input files and creates a data structure to represent the logic gates and their inputs and outputs. It uses initial input values to calculate the output values of the gates, using the logic defined by each gate type (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, XAND).
The program calculates the output values of the gates, using the updated input values, until all gates have been resolved. Finally, the program outputs the final values of all outputs.
